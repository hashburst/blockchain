## Adaptive Proof of Work

###**Optimizing Hashburst's Proof of Work (PoW)**

To optimize and reduce energy consumption in the Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism used by **Hashburst**, this project implements an **Adaptive Proof of Work (APoW)**. This approach adjusts the difficulty dynamically based on factors like network load, miner efficiency, or power consumption. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Adjust Difficulty Dynamically**:
   
   - Calculate the average time miners take to solve a block.
     
   - If the time is too short, increase difficulty; if too long, decrease it.

3. **Energy-Efficient Hashing**:
   
   - Implement efficient hashing algorithms like **SHA-3** or **Blake2**, which offer better performance per watt.
     
   - Use **ASIC-resistant algorithms** like **Equihash** to make sure that mining isn't dominated by high-power machines.

5. **Use Proof of Stake (PoS) Hybrid**:
   
   - Combine PoW with **Proof of Stake (PoS)** to lower the reliance on power-hungry mining.
