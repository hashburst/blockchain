### **Developing HashburstCore**

**HashburstCore** has been built like a full-node client in **Golang** that integrates with the EVM, supports the optimized PoW (APoW), and provides the essential blockchain operations (mining, transactions, and wallet management). 
Here's an outline of the steps to develop the **HashburstCore** project.

#### 1. **Key Features to Include**:

   - **Full Node**: sync with the network, validate transactions, and mine blocks using the optimized PoW.
     
   - **Wallet Management**: generate wallets, manage addresses, and sign transactions.
     
   - **EVM Integration**: execute **smart contracts** on the Hashburst blockchain.
     
   - **Mining Support**: allow users to mine tokens using the optimized **APoW mechanism**.
   
#### 2. **Project Setup in Golang**

##### a. **Install Golang**

                   bash
          
                   sudo apt update
                   sudo apt install golang

##### b. **Create Project Structure**

                   bash
                
                   mkdir HashburstCore
                   cd HashburstCore
                   go mod init hashburstcore
                   mkdir cmd internal pkg

##### c. **Write the Core Functionality (Mining, Wallet, etc.)**

                  go
                  
                  // cmd/hashburstcore/main.go
                  
                  package main
                  
                  import (
                      "fmt"
                      "os"
                      "hashburstcore/mining"
                      "hashburstcore/wallet"
                  )
                  
                  func main() {
                      if len(os.Args) < 2 {
                          fmt.Println("Usage: hashburstcore [mine|wallet]")
                          return
                      }
                      switch os.Args[1] {
                      case "mine":
                          mining.StartMining()
                      case "wallet":
                          wallet.GenerateWallet()
                      default:
                          fmt.Println("Unknown command")
                      }
                  }

##### d. **Implement Mining Logic (APoW)**

                      DifficultyAdjustmentWindow = 10            // Adjust difficulty after every 10 blocks
                      InitialDifficulty          = 16            // Starting difficulty level
                  )

                      timeTaken := time.Since(lastBlockTime).Seconds()
                      expectedTime := TargetBlockTime * DifficultyAdjustmentWindow
                  
                      if timeTaken < expectedTime {
                          currentDifficulty = new(big.Int).Mul(currentDifficulty, big.NewInt(2)) // Increase difficulty
                          fmt.Println("Increased difficulty")
                      } else if timeTaken > expectedTime {
                          currentDifficulty = new(big.Int).Div(currentDifficulty, big.NewInt(2)) // Decrease difficulty
                          fmt.Println("Decreased difficulty")
                      }
                  }
                  
                  // distributeRewards splits rewards between the miner and stakers (PoS component)
                  func distributeRewards(miner string, block *Block) {
                      blockReward := big.NewInt(50) // Example block reward
                  
                      // Miner gets half the reward
                      minerReward := new(big.Int).Div(blockReward, big.NewInt(2))
                      fmt.Printf("Miner %s rewarded %s tokens\n", miner, minerReward.String())
                  
                      // Stakers share the other half (in PoS hybrid)
                      stakerReward := new(big.Int).Div(blockReward, big.NewInt(2))
                      rewardStakers(stakerReward)
                  }
                  
                  // rewardStakers distributes rewards to stakeholders
                  func rewardStakers(stakerReward *big.Int) {
                      // This can be based on stakes (PoS component)
                      stakers := []string{"staker1", "staker2"} // Example stakers
                      for _, staker := range stakers {
                          fmt.Printf("Rewarding staker %s with %s tokens\n", staker, stakerReward.String())
                      }
                  }
                  
                  // generateNonce generates a random nonce for the block
                  func generateNonce() int64 {
                      n, err := rand.Int(rand.Reader, big.NewInt(1<<63))
                      if err != nil {
                          panic(err)
                      }
                      return n.Int64()
                  }

   **Explanation of the Code**:
   
   1. **Difficulty Adjustment**: the difficulty is dynamically adjusted after every 10 blocks using the adjustDifficulty() function.
      If blocks are mined too quickly, the difficulty increases, and if blocks are mined too slowly, it decreases.
      
   2. **Energy-Efficient Hashing with Blake2b**: instead of SHA-256, Blake2b is used to hash the block data in a more energy-efficient manner.
      
   3. **Proof of Stake (PoS) Hybrid**: the function distributeRewards() splits the block reward between the miner (for Proof of Work) and a set of stakeholders (for Proof of Stake), encouraging decentralization and energy efficiency.
   
   4. **Mining Logic**: the main mining loop continuously generates blocks.
      For each block, a hash is calculated, and the nonce is adjusted until a valid hash is found that meets the current difficulty.
   
   5. **Generating Nonces**: the generateNonce() function generates random nonces for use in mining attempts.
      
   ##### How it Works:
   
   - **Adaptive Proof of Work (APoW)** adjusts the mining difficulty based on block times, ensuring optimal performance while reducing energy consumption.
   - **Blake2b** ensures that hashing is more energy-efficient compared to traditional algorithms.
   - **PoW/PoS Hybrid** encourages not just mining (energy-intensive) but also staking (energy-efficient).
     
   ##### Next Steps:
   
   - **Testing**: once implemented, test the mining process using real-world data and validate how effectively the **APoW system** adjusts difficulty.
   - **Integration**: integrate this module into the broader Hashburst blockchain, ensuring that it communicates with the node network and wallet services properly.

##### e. **Wallet Implementation**

                  go
                  
                  // internal/wallet/wallet.go
                  
                  package wallet
                  
                  import (
                      "fmt"
                      "crypto/ecdsa"
                      "crypto/rand"
                      "crypto/elliptic"
                  )
                  
                  func GenerateWallet() {
                      priv, _ := ecdsa.GenerateKey(elliptic.P256(), rand.Reader)
                      fmt.Printf("New Wallet: Private Key: %x\n", priv.D)
                  }

#### 3. **Build Instructions for Multiple Platforms**

To build **cross-platform binaries** for Windows, Mac and Linux using **Go's cross-compilation feature**.

##### a. **Build for Linux**:

                  bash
                  
                  GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o hashburstcore_linux cmd/hashburstcore/main.go

##### b. **Build for Windows**:

                  bash
                  
                  GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o hashburstcore.exe cmd/hashburstcore/main.go

##### c. **Build for Mac**:

                  bash
                  
                  GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o hashburstcore_mac cmd/hashburstcore/main.go

#### 4. **Final Steps**:

- Test the client on each platform.
  
- Ensure the full node can sync with the network and mine blocks using the new **APoW**.

This project provides a multi-platform client similar to BitcoinCore or DogecoinCore, optimized for Hashburst's unique blockchain.
