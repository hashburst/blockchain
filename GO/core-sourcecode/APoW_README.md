**Adaptive Proof of Work (APoW)** into the **Hashburst blockchain project**

Dynamically adjusting difficulty, using energy-efficient hashing algorithms, and introducing a PoW/PoS hybrid mechanism. 
This will optimize energy consumption and improve mining efficiency.

### Focus:

By integrating an **Adaptive Proof of Work (APoW)** system with energy-efficient hashing algorithms and a **Proof of Stake (PoS)** hybrid, Hashburst Blockchain can significantly reduce the power consumption and improve the fairness of the Hashburst mining system.
This combination of dynamic difficulty adjustment, efficient hashing, and stake-based rewards ensures a more sustainable and decentralized blockchain.

### Step 1: **Adaptive Proof of Work (APoW) - Adjust Difficulty Dynamically**

Here’s how to implement this in **Go** as the project is written in **GoLang**.

#### a. **Track Block Mining Time**:

The first step is to calculate the average time it takes to mine a block. Based on this, we adjust the mining difficulty dynamically.

                    go
                    
                    package blockchain
                    
                    import (
                        "time"
                        "math/big"
                        "fmt"
                    )
                    
                    // Set the target block time in seconds (e.g., 10 minutes)
                    const TargetBlockTime = 600 
                    
                    // DifficultyAdjustmentWindow is the number of blocks after which difficulty is adjusted
                    const DifficultyAdjustmentWindow = 10 
                    
                    // Last block's timestamp and current difficulty
                    var lastBlockTime time.Time
                    var currentDifficulty *big.Int = big.NewInt(1) // Initial difficulty
                    
                    // Function to dynamically adjust difficulty
                    func AdjustDifficulty(lastBlockTimestamp time.Time, blockHeight int) *big.Int {
                        if blockHeight%DifficultyAdjustmentWindow != 0 {
                            // No adjustment needed
                            return currentDifficulty
                        }
                    
                        // Time difference between the last `DifficultyAdjustmentWindow` blocks
                        timeTaken := time.Since(lastBlockTimestamp).Seconds()
                        expectedTime := TargetBlockTime * DifficultyAdjustmentWindow
                    
                        if timeTaken < expectedTime {
                            // If blocks are being mined too fast, increase the difficulty
                            currentDifficulty = new(big.Int).Mul(currentDifficulty, big.NewInt(2)) // Double difficulty
                            fmt.Println("Increased difficulty due to fast mining")
                        } else if timeTaken > expectedTime {
                            // If blocks are being mined too slowly, reduce the difficulty
                            currentDifficulty = new(big.Int).Div(currentDifficulty, big.NewInt(2)) // Halve difficulty
                            fmt.Println("Decreased difficulty due to slow mining")
                        }
                        return currentDifficulty
                    }

#### b. **Integrate the Difficulty Adjustment with Mining Logic**:

In the main blockchain mining loop, you’ll call `AdjustDifficulty()` each time a new block is mined.

                    go
                    
                    func MineBlock(block *Block) {
                        for {
                            // Check if the hash of the block satisfies the current difficulty
                            if IsValidHash(block.Hash(), currentDifficulty) {
                                // Valid block found
                                fmt.Println("Block mined: ", block.Hash())
                                break
                            }
                            // Increment nonce and try again
                            block.Nonce++
                        }
                    
                        // Adjust difficulty after mining each block
                        block.Difficulty = AdjustDifficulty(block.Timestamp, block.Height)
                    }


### Step 2: **Energy-Efficient Hashing**

#### a. **Switch to an Energy-Efficient Algorithm (SHA-3/Blake2)**:

To optimize for better energy performance per watt, the traditional **SHA-256** can be replaced with more energy-efficient hashing algorithms like **SHA-3** or **Blake2**.

**Example with Blake2:**

                    go
                    
                    import (
                        "golang.org/x/crypto/blake2b"
                    )
                    
                    // Use Blake2 hashing function for more energy-efficient mining
                    func HashBlock(data []byte) []byte {
                        hash := blake2b.Sum256(data)
                        return hash[:]
                    }

#### b. **Integrate Blake2 into the Mining Process**:

Modify the block mining function to use **Blake2** instead of SHA-256:

                    go
                    
                    func IsValidHash(hash []byte, difficulty *big.Int) bool {
                        target := new(big.Int).Lsh(big.NewInt(1), uint(256-difficulty.BitLen()))
                        hashInt := new(big.Int).SetBytes(hash)
                        return hashInt.Cmp(target) < 0
                    }

### Step 3: **Hybrid PoW and PoS Mechanism**

In addition to **Proof of Work**, a **Proof of Stake** can be introduced component to reduce reliance on power-hungry mining by rewarding users who hold a significant stake in the blockchain.
The stake-based reward system can be introduced by distributing some rewards based on token holdings.

#### 1. **Introduce a Staking Mechanism**:

                    go
                    
                    type Staker struct {
                        Address string
                        Stake   *big.Int
                    }
                    
                    var stakers []Staker
                    
                    // Function to reward stakers based on their stake
                    func RewardStakers(blockReward *big.Int) {
                        totalStake := big.NewInt(0)
                        for _, staker := range stakers {
                            totalStake.Add(totalStake, staker.Stake)
                        }
                    
                        for _, staker := range stakers {
                            reward := new(big.Int).Div(new(big.Int).Mul(staker.Stake, blockReward), totalStake)
                            fmt.Printf("Rewarding staker %s with %s tokens\n", staker.Address, reward.String())
                        }
                    }
                    
                    // Function to handle both mining and staking rewards
                    func DistributeRewards(miner string, blockReward *big.Int) {
                        minerReward := new(big.Int).Div(blockReward, big.NewInt(2)) // 50% for miner
                        fmt.Printf("Miner %s receives %s tokens\n", miner, minerReward.String())
                        
                        // Distribute the other 50% to stakers
                        RewardStakers(new(big.Int).Div(blockReward, big.NewInt(2)))
                    }

#### 2. **Integrate the Hybrid PoW/PoS Mechanism into Mining**:

                    go
                    
                    func MineBlockWithPoS(miner string, block *Block, blockReward *big.Int) {
                        // Perform mining using PoW
                        MineBlock(block)
                    
                        // Distribute rewards to miner and stakers using PoW/PoS hybrid model
                        DistributeRewards(miner, blockReward)
                    }

### Step 4: **Final Integration into the Hashburst Repository**

1. **Add the Code to the Hashburst Blockchain**:
   
   - Place all blockchain-related code in the **`/blockchain`** folder of the Hashburst repository.
     
   - The **APoW** logic goes into the **mining** component of the project.

2. **Update the `main.go` or `miner.go`** file to use the new APoW mechanism:
   
   - Replace the traditional PoW logic with the new **`AdjustDifficulty()`** function.
     
   - Add staking logic to reward stakers alongside miners.

3. **Push the Changes**:

                    bash
                    
                    git add .
                    git commit -m "Added Adaptive Proof of Work (APoW) and PoS hybrid mechanism"
                    git push origin main
