To integrate a smart contract system into Hashburst Blockchain and extend it with support for HBT-20 and HBT-721 standards (compatible with TRC, ERC, and BEP standards) means  implement the contracts using Solidity and a framework for token minting (both fungible and non-fungible tokens) within the ecosystem.
This will enable issuing assets like utility tokens, security tokens, and asset tokens.

### 1. **Smart Contract Standards (HBT-20 and HBT-721)**

Build two contract standards:

- **HBT-20**: a fungible token standard compatible with ERC-20, TRC-20, and BEP-20, enabling basic token features like transfer, balance query, and approval.
- **HBT-721**: a non-fungible token (NFT) standard compatible with ERC-721, TRC-721, and BEP-721, facilitating unique asset creation (NFTs).

### 2. **Solidity Implementation of HBT-20 Token (Fungible Tokens)**

Here’s a Solidity implementation of the HBT-20 standard:

solidity
                  
                  // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
                  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
                  
                  contract HBT20 {
                      string public name = "Hashburst Token";
                      string public symbol = "HBT";
                      uint8 public decimals = 18;
                      uint256 public totalSupply;
                  
                      mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;
                      mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowance;
                  
                      event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
                      event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
                  
                      constructor(uint256 _initialSupply) {
                          balanceOf[msg.sender] = _initialSupply;
                          totalSupply = _initialSupply;
                      }
                  
                      function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
                          require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _value, "Insufficient balance");
                          balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _value;
                          balanceOf[_to] += _value;
                          emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
                          return true;
                      }
                  
                      function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
                          allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
                          emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
                          return true;
                      }
                  
                      function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
                          require(_value <= balanceOf[_from], "Insufficient balance");
                          require(_value <= allowance[_from][msg.sender], "Allowance exceeded");
                          balanceOf[_from] -= _value;
                          balanceOf[_to] += _value;
                          allowance[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
                          emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
                          return true;
                      }
                  }


### 3. **Solidity Implementation of HBT-721 Token (Non-Fungible Tokens)**

Next, a non-fungible token (HBT-721) implementation:


                  solidity
                  
                  // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
                  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
                  
                  import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
                  import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";
                  
                  contract HBT721 is ERC721 {
                      using Counters for Counters.Counter;
                      Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;
                  
                      constructor() ERC721("HashburstNFT", "HBTNFT") {}
                  
                      function mintNFT(address recipient, string memory tokenURI) public returns (uint256) {
                          _tokenIds.increment();
                  
                          uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds.current();
                          _mint(recipient, newItemId);
                          _setTokenURI(newItemId, tokenURI);
                  
                          return newItemId;
                      }
                  }


### 4. **Integration of a Smart Contract Execution Engine**

To execute smart contracts generated within the Hashburst ecosystem, the blockchain must support an **EVM-compatible execution environment**. This can be done using the `go-ethereum` (Geth) client.

- **Geth Integration**: use `geth` to run smart contracts on a **private network** or integrate it with external APIs for exchanges and Web3 systems.
  
Here’s an example of deploying smart contracts programmatically with `geth`:


                  bash
                  
                  geth --http --http.api eth,net,web3 --http.addr 0.0.0.0 --allow-insecure-unlock


This exposes a JSON-RPC API to interact with smart contracts from third-party systems (like exchanges or explorers).

### 5. **Minting and Distributing Tokens via API**

This is tbe basic code to develop a RESTful APIs using **Web3.js** or **Ethers.js** to allow third-party applications (exchanges, digital banks, explorers, etc.) to interact with the blockchain and manage token issuance.

An example of token minting via API using **Ethers.js**:


                  javascript
                  
                  const { ethers } = require("ethers");
                  
                  async function mintToken(contractAddress, to, value) {
                      const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("http://localhost:8545");
                      const wallet = new ethers.Wallet("YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY", provider);
                  
                      const abi = [
                          "function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public returns (bool)"
                      ];
                  
                      const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, wallet);
                      const tx = await contract.mint(to, value);
                      await tx.wait();
                      console.log(`Minted ${value} tokens to ${to}`);
                  }

#### **API Integration for Token Minting and Distribution**
  
  After deploying the smart contracts (HBT-20 and HBT-721) across Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Tron, you can build APIs to facilitate token minting and distribution to third-party platforms like exchanges and digital banks.
  
  1. **Web3 Integration for Ethereum/BSC**: use **Web3.js** to build API endpoints that interact with the smart contracts, allowing external systems to mint tokens, transfer them, or check balances. Example:
     
     
                   javascript
                   
                   const Web3 = require('web3');
                   const web3 = new Web3('https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/');
                   
                   const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(contractABI, contractAddress);
                   
                   async function mintTokens(to, amount) {
                       const tx = contract.methods.mint(to, amount);
                       const gas = await tx.estimateGas({from: 'YOUR_ADDRESS'});
                       const receipt = await tx.send({from: 'YOUR_ADDRESS', gas});
                       console.log('Transaction Hash:', receipt.transactionHash);
                   }
     
  
  2. **TronWeb Integration for Tron**: use **TronWeb** to expose API endpoints for third-party systems to mint and transfer TRC-20 or TRC-721 tokens. Example:
     
     
                   javascript
                   
                   async function mintTRC20(to, amount) {
                       const tx = await contract.mint(to, amount).send();
                       console.log('Minted TRC20:', tx);
                   }
     
  
  3. **Exposing APIs for Third-Party Systems**: APIs can be exposed over HTTP/REST for third-party systems to interact with tokens. This allows exchanges, digital banks, or explorers to integrate with the Hashburst ecosystem to track and trade tokens.
     
  4. **API for Token Interaction**: to build a robust API system that allows third-party systems like exchanges, digital banks, and explorers to interact with the Hashburst blockchain, this system exposes API endpoints over **HTTP/REST**. These APIs will enable integration with external platforms, allowing them to track, mint, and trade fungible (HBT-20) and non-fungible tokens (HBT-721).
     
  5. **API System Design**: below is a detailed plan on how to design and implement such an API system.

  #### **5.a. API Endpoint Structure**
    
  Base URL for the API, such as:
    
    
                  https://hashburst.io/blockchain/v2/api/contracts
    
    
  The API will expose several endpoints for different functionalities:
    
  - **Mint Tokens**: Allows third-party systems to mint tokens.
  - **Transfer Tokens**: Facilitates transferring tokens between addresses.
  - **Check Balance**: Queries the balance of a particular wallet.
  - **Get Contract Information**: Fetches the smart contract details and transaction history.
    
  API structure:
    
    
                  plaintext
                      
                  POST /contracts/mint          # Mint new tokens
                  POST /contracts/transfer      # Transfer tokens
                  GET  /contracts/balance       # Get token balance
                  GET  /contracts/info          # Get smart contract info
    
    
  #### **5.b. Token Minting API**
    
  This API endpoint will allow authorized third-party systems (exchanges, digital banks, etc.) to mint fungible tokens (HBT-20) or non-fungible tokens (HBT-721).
    
  - **Endpoint**: `POST /contracts/mint`

                            }
                          }
                        ]
                      }
    
  #### **5.e. Fetching Smart Contract Information**
    
  To allow third-party systems to verify and track contracts, this endpoint will fetch details of a smart contract and provide transaction history.
    
  - **Endpoint**: `GET /contracts/info`
  - **Parameters**:
    - `contract_address`: The address of the token contract.
    
  Sample of request:
    
                    GET /contracts/info?contract_address=0xYourContractAddress
    
  Sample of response:

                        "total_supply": 1000000,
                        "creator": "0xCreatorAddress",
                        "transactions": [
                          {
                            "tx_hash": "0xTxHash1",
                            "from": "0xSenderAddress",
                            "to": "0xRecipientAddress",
                            "amount": 100
                          },

                            "amount": 50
                          }
                        ]
                      }
    
  #### **5.f. Security and Authorization**
    
  To ensure only authorized third-party systems can access the API, implement authentication using **API keys** or **OAuth2**. Additionally, ensure:
  - **Encryption**: use HTTPS to secure communication.
  - **Rate Limiting**: protect against abuse by implementing rate limits.
  - **Role-Based Access Control**: differentiate between roles, such as exchanges, digital banks and explorers.
    
  #### **5.g. API Deployment**
    
  To host and expose the API, use platforms like **Node.js** or **Python Flask** with **Express** or **FastAPI** for backend development.
    
  Sample of API deployment using **Express** (Node.js):
    
                      javascript
                      
                      const express = require('express');
                      const app = express();
                      app.use(express.json());
                      
                      app.post('/blockchain/v2/api/contracts/mint', (req, res) => {
                        const { contract_address, to_address, amount } = req.body;
                        // Logic to interact with Web3 and mint tokens
                        res.send(`Minted ${amount} tokens to ${to_address}`);
                      });
                      
                      app.listen(3000, () => {
                        console.log('API running on http://localhost:3000');
                      });
    
  For production deployment:
  - Use cloud services like **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, or **Azure**.
  - Use **Docker** to containerize the API for easy scaling and deployment.
    
  ### **Summary**
  
  The API exposed at `https://hashburst.io/blockchain/v2/api/contracts` will provide third-party systems with access to essential smart contract functionalities like minting, transferring tokens, and fetching balance and contract details. This ensures smooth integration between the Hashburst blockchain and external platforms (exchanges, banks, explorers), enabling token management and secure interaction across the ecosystem.
  
### 6. **Integration with TRC, ERC, and BEP Standards**

The implemented contracts are designed to follow **ERC-20/721 standards** closely, ensuring compatibility with **BEP-20/721** and **TRC-20/721**.
To provide a clearer understanding of how the smart contracts implemented in Solidity (for HBT-20 and HBT-721) can be integrated across multiple blockchain ecosystems (specifically **Ethereum (ERC-20/721)**, **Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20/721)**, and **Tron (TRC-20/721)**), here's a deeper look at the technical processes involved:

- **1.For BEP tokens**: the tokens can be deployed on the **Binance Smart Chain** using similar interfaces.
  
  #### BEP-20/721 Token Deployment on Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**
  
  The Binance Smart Chain is fully EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible, so any smart contract written for ERC-20 and ERC-721 can be deployed to BSC with little to no modification.
  
  ##### **Steps for Deployment on BSC:**
  
  - **Smart Contract Compatibility**: since BSC is compatible with Ethereum, the Solidity code for **HBT-20** and **HBT-721** (fungible and non-fungible tokens) does not require changes.
    
  - **Deployment Using Remix or Truffle**:
    - Use **Remix** or **Truffle** to deploy the contract by connecting to BSC’s RPC endpoint.
    - Example RPC Endpoint: `https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/`
    
  - **Network Configuration for MetaMask**:
    - Add BSC to your **MetaMask** wallet by configuring a custom RPC, ensuring smooth interaction with the Binance Smart Chain.
  
  - **Gas Fees**: Transactions on BSC use **BNB** as the native currency for gas fees, so ensure that your deployment account holds sufficient BNB.
  

                  bash
                  
                  truffle migrate --network binance



- **2.For TRC tokens**: You’ll need to use the **TronLink** SDK for deploying TRC-20/721 tokens, ensuring compatibility across multiple chains.
  
  #### TRC-20/721 Token Deployment on the Tron Blockchain**
  
  For **TRC-20** (fungible tokens) and **TRC-721** (non-fungible tokens), Tron’s architecture is different from Ethereum, but Tron offers its own tools for deploying smart contracts and interacting with the blockchain. The **TronLink Web** and **TronWeb** libraries facilitate easy deployment and interaction with Tron smart contracts.
  
  ##### **Steps for TRC-20/721 Token Deployment:**
  
  - **Rewrite Contracts for Tron**: even though Tron smart contracts are also written in Solidity, the **Solidity version** and certain **features** (like the `msg` global variable) are handled differently.
    - Use **Solidity version 0.4.25** for Tron smart contracts.
    - Replace `msg.sender` and `msg.value` with Tron-specific syntax.
  
  - **TronLink Web Wallet**: TronLink allows users to interact with Tron-based dApps, similar to how MetaMask works for Ethereum. Use this tool to sign transactions and deploy smart contracts.
  
  - **TronWeb**: This is a JavaScript API for interacting with the Tron blockchain programmatically. You can use **TronWeb** to deploy your TRC-20 or TRC-721 contracts directly from your code or dApp.
  
    Example deployment using **TronWeb**:
  
    
                  javascript
                  
                  const TronWeb = require('tronweb');
                
                  const tronWeb = new TronWeb({
                      fullHost: 'https://api.trongrid.io',
                      privateKey: 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY'
                  });
                
                  const contract = await tronWeb.contract().new({
                      abi: contractABI,  // ABI of the contract
                      bytecode: contractBytecode  // Bytecode of the contract
                  });
                
                  console.log('Contract Address:', contract.address);
    
  
  - **Tron-Specific Tools**:
    - **TronGrid**: a tool similar to Ethereum's Infura, which allows access to the Tron blockchain through APIs without running a full node.
    - **TronStation**: a tool to estimate gas costs and monitor network performance, similar to Ethereum's Gas Station.

    #### **Cross-Chain Compatibility and Interoperability**
      
      To ensure full interoperability:
      
      - **Cross-Chain Bridges**: deploy cross-chain bridges to facilitate asset transfers between networks like Ethereum, BSC, and Tron.
      - **Interoperability Libraries**: use solutions like **RenVM** or **Cosmos** to enable cross-chain token swaps.
      
      By using **Web3.js** for Ethereum/BSC and **TronWeb** for Tron, your smart contracts (HBT-20 and HBT-721) will be compatible across these ecosystems, allowing the minting and distribution of tokens across major blockchain standards.
    

### 7. **Deployment and Interaction via APIs**

Finally, to distribute tokens and manage transactions via API, use Web3 services:

- **Explorer Integration**: Provide endpoints to track smart contracts, transactions, and token issuance.
- **Exchanges and Wallets**: Offer APIs for minting tokens, querying balances, and managing transactions.

This framework will enable the Hashburst Blockchain to support complex smart contract operations and seamlessly integrate with external systems, ensuring interoperability with major blockchain standards.
