# Hashburst Networks Builder Framework

## Overview
This framework integrates the capabilities of Hashburst Blockchain and Peer-to-Peer Networks, designed to enhance blockchain functionalities such as mining, minting, and AI-driven operations.
It aims to establish decentralized communication, transaction management, payment gateways, and asset collateral generation through mining other altcoins.
Additionally, it uses cloud computing to create distributed cluster systems, aligning with its own native philosophy of resilient, free networks.

# Project Structure:
The package will be structured in a modular way, where each module corresponds to a functionality (e.g., mining, minting, communication, payments, etc.).
Each feature is implemented through libraries which communicate internally to fulfill the frameworkâ€™s purpose.

This package contains a complete code implementation of the libraries for each functionality, including an example of a peer-to-peer cloud cluster orchestrating nodes for mining.

# Usage Example

                              if __name__ == "__main__":
                                  # Mining example
